Just walked outta the theater, my back's aching like a tectonic plate finally giving in to the inevitable fault slip. The King of Kings – wow, didn’t expect to see so much metaphorical lava pouring out of those scenes. It was like... an eruption of emotion, you know? The title's grand but, man, those visuals – they were like minerals sparkling unexpectedly under sunlight. A bit overwhelming but in a good way.

Popcorn crumbs everywhere, feels like a crumbling sedimentary rock in my lap. And the noise! The surround sound was seismic – like standing next to a rumbling volcano. There's something about watching a theatrical epic especially when you're immersed, but still part of the crowd, you know? Chaotic yet cohesive in its own absurd rhythm.

> That scene with the chariots racing. My God, it was like molten magma racing down a slope, unstoppable and raw. Something magnetic about it, probably Pola Negri's eyes or was it her presence? Can't recall exactly, but there's a grandeur that lingers, like a mountain range etched into the sky. Someone mentioned I should download the movie, but it's the kinda thing you gotta watch the movie in a theater – the immensity gets lost on a small screen, just like how the Grand Canyon never seems as grand in photos.

And then, there’s that quiet moment, unexpectedly introspective, rocks tumbling slowly down a cliff, changing landscape – absolutely haunting. Felt like an ancient landscape that's seen eons pass and was now watching history repeat itself. Messy plot at times, kinda like a jumbled fossil record, but it's hard not to get swept up in the immensity, a sovereign king holding the winds at bay.

Oh, and the random appearances of camels? Like adding quartz to sandstone, somehow elevating the whole construct, slightly out of place, yet belonging. More than once did I think - Is this where cinema and geology meet? Yeah, crazy thought.

Tried to jot these thoughts as soon as I sat down, sorry if it's all over the place. Brain's still whirling, probably need a minute to recalibrate to life outside the screen, kind of like adjusting after a minor earthquake tremor.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   printf(Hello, World!);
   return 0;
}
```
Seems that just popped in from nowhere, better sort my tabs...
